# Score Transformer (fork)

This is an upgraded implementation of the score similarity metric introduced in http://www.dollos.it/assets/pdf/ismir2017.pdf and further extended in https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00355.

Changes:
- Much faster alignment procedure using `numba`
- Added support for expressions and ornaments
- Only compute metrics for notes (not rests)
- Unroll repeats
- Strip all ties

Please note that this version requires a modified version of `music21`, which can be found here: https://github.com/TimFelixBeyer/music21

## Usage

```python
from score_transformer import score_similarity
print(score_similarity(path_a, path_b)
```


## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
from score_transformer import score_similarity
score_similarity("test1.musicxml", "test2.musicxml")
# or
import music21
score_similarity(music21.converter.parse("test1.musicxml"), music21.converter.parse("test2.musicxml"))
```
